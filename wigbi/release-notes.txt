Wigbi 1.0.0 [2011-01-01]
************************

Wigbi 1.0.0 is a complete rewrite of previous Wigbi versions. New developers
are adviced to check out the documentation, demos and tutorials on wigbi.com.
The release feature major changes, of which only some are listed down below.

The Wigbi configuration file has been completely rewritten and uses real ini
sections. Older configuration files will not work with Wigbi 1.0.

Wigbi no longer features bundled classes. All the source code is provided as
is, which simplifies modifications and bug fixes in an already running Wigbi
instance. The two wigbi/php/wigbi and wigbi/js/wigbi folders are now removed
as well. The Wigbi classes are added directly in wigbi/php and wigbi/js. 

It is now possible to change the value of the Wigbi::configFile(..) property
to make Wigbi use another configuration file when starting up. However, note
that the property is currently not set for the JS Wigbi class, since the PHP
property is relative and the JavaScript property must be app relative. It is
important that you change the Wigbi._ajaxConfigFile variable as well for now.

Some Wigbi classes that were previously static have now been made non-static
to make it possible to create custom instances. However, the Wigbi class has
default instances of these classes that are setup with the Wigbi config file.

All property methods have been modified. Instead of x()/setX(..), properties
now take an optional set parameter if they are settabl...just like jQuery :) 

Wigbi now features a quite basic MVC engine which is inspired by ASP.NET MVC.
This makes it even easier to separate functionality from content.

The WigbiUIPlugin base class has been simplified compared to the old one. It
contains a few help methods and must still be inherited.
