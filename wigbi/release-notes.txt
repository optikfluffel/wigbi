Wigbi 1.0.0 [2011-01-01]
************************

Wigbi 1.0.0 is a complete rewrite of previous Wigbi versions. New developers
are adviced to check out the documentation, demos and tutorials on wigbi.com.
The release feature major changes, of which only some are listed down below.

The Wigbi configuration file has been completely rewritten and uses real ini
sections. Older configuration files will not work with Wigbi 1.0.

It is now possible to change the value of the Wigbi::configFile(..) property
to make Wigbi use another configuration file when starting up. However, make
sure to notice that the property is currently not set for the JS Wigbi class,
since the PHP property is relative and the JavaScript property has got to be
application relative. Thus, if you change the config file, make sure to also
set the Wigbi._ajaxConfigFile JavaScript variable.

Some Wigbi classes that were previously static have now been made non-static
to make it possible to create custom instances. However, the Wigbi class has
default instances of these classes that are setup with the Wigbi config file.

All property methods have been modified. Instead of x()/setX(..), properties
now take an optional set parameter if they are settabl...just like jQuery :) 

Wigbi now features a quite basic MVC engine which is inspired by ASP.NET MVC.
This makes it even easier to separate functionality from content.

Wigbi now uses jQuery 1.4.2 instead of previous 1.3.2. jQuery is included in
the Wigbi release, so there is no need to download it separately.

The WigbiUIPlugin base class has been simplified compared to the old one. It
contains a few help methods and must still be inherited.
