/**
 * The Wigbi.PHP.Core.WigbiDataPluginList class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to make a WigbiDataPlugin object contain a
 * list of other WigbiDataPlugin objects. For instance, User objects
 * could store other User objects in a list called "friends".
 * 
 * This class is not intended to be manually used. Instead, it is to
 * be used through the WigbiDataPlugin class' various list functions.
 * 
 * 
 * SYNCED VS. NON-SYNCED LISTS ***********************
 * 
 * A data plugin list can either be synced or non-synced. For synced
 * lists, objects are automatically deleted if they are removed from
 * the list or if the parent object is deleted. Non-synced lists, on
 * the other hand, will never delete any object within it.
 * 
 * For instance, consider a User friend list. Just because a user is
 * removed from the list does not mean that he/she should be deleted.
 * In this case, use a non-synced list. On the other hand, if a user
 * has a blog, the blog and all its posts should probably be deleted
 * together with the user. In this case, use a synced list. 
 * 
 * 
 * DEFAULT SORT RULE *********************************
 * 
 * A data plugin list can be set to have a default sort rule that is
 * applied when objects are retrieved with the getListItems() method.
 * For instance, the friend list above should maybe use "name()", so
 * that all users are listed alphabetically.
 * 
 * Using a default sort rule is optional. If none is set, list items
 * will be returned in the order they were added to the list.
