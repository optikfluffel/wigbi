/**
 * The Wigbi.PHP.View class.
 * 
 * This class represents a general view, that can be used in an MVC
 * based application. The class is static, since only one view at a
 * time is handled by Wigbi, even for nested views.
 * 
 * To add a view to the page, which can be done in the controller as
 * well as within in any view, just use the View::addView() function.
 * 
 * Data can be passed to a view using the associative ViewData array
 * property, which is available to all views, or by simply passing a
 * custom model object as a second optional parameter to the addView
 * method. The model will only be available to that particular view.
