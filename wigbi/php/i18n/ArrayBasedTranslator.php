/**
 * The Wigbi ArrayBasedTranslator class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to load and handle language data that is
 * provided as an array.
 * 
 * Language keys can consist of one or several parts. If a key has
 * one or several _ in its name, the _ will be used as a separator.
 * 
 * When the translator attempts to translate the key, it will take
 * all existing parts and attempt to translate them hierarchically.
 * 
 * For "foo_bar_foobar", the class will try all these translations
 * (in the given order):
 * 
 * <code>
 *	foo_bar_foobar=The most specific translation, returned first
 *	bar_foobar=Only returned if the above does not exist
 *	foobar=If none of the above keys exists, this will be returned
 * </code>
 * 
 * If no match is found, the class returns the key name wrapped in
 * a [], like [main_greeting].
