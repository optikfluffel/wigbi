/**
 * The Wigbi MasterPage class.
 * 
 * This static class can be used to define page templates that can
 * be used by several pages. The master page defines content areas
 * that can be populated by each page, using open(...) and close().
 * 
 * A page that uses a master page must NOT generate content out of
 * an open/close pair, since such content will be displayed at the
 * very top of the page.
