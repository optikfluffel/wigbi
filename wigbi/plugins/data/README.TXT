Wigbi data plugin instructions
==============================

Author: Daniel Saidi [daniel.saidi@gmail.com]


To add a data plugin to a Wigbi application, simply copy the
plugin file to this folder. Wigbi will automatically use all
data plugins that are placed within the folder.

To make sure that Wigbi will create a database table as well
as a JavaScript class for the plugin, do make sure to enable
the RTB option in the config file for the next time Wigbi is
started. After that, it can be disabled again.
