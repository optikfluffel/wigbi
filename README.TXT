Author: Daniel Saidi [daniel.saidi@gmail.com]

Wigbi is a minimalistic PHP/JavaScript application framework
that features a lot of easy-to use, straightforward features
out of the box.

This repository contains:

	* wigbi/ - The latest version with all source code and all you need to use Wigbi
	* plugins/ - All available Wigbi plugins, both data and UI
	* tests/ - Folder with unit tests and test resources
	* 
	* index_wigbi.php - A simple index page that verifies that Wigbi works
	* test.php - A page that runs all Wigbi unit tests
 
Until Wigbi 1 is released, you are more than welcome to grab
the source code and have a look at it...and to use the Wigbi
build as you see fit.
