 * The Wigbi.Plugins.Data.Message class.

 * This class represents a general message, that can be sent between

 * If messages are sent between two objects, it may be convenient to
 * add the message to an inbox for the recipient and also add a copy
 * to an outbox for the recipient. This way, each object has its own
 * copy of the message.
