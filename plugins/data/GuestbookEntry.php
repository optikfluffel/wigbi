/**
 * The Wigbi.Plugins.Data.GuestbookEntry class.
 * 
 * This class represents a guestbook entry that can be applied to an
 * object of any kind, although it most probably will be used to let
 * two persons to communicate. 
 * 
 * The easiest way to connect a guestbok entry to another Wigbi data
 * plugin class is to add a synced data list to the target class and
 * add the entry to the list. This will make sure that the guestbook
 * entry is deleted together with the object. 
 * 
 * The senderId and receiverId properties can also be used as object
 * references to provide fully traceable guestbook entries.
