/**
 * The Wigbi.Plugins.Data.Message class.
 * 
 * This class represents a general message, that can be sent between
 * two objects, which will probably be users. However, the class can
 * be used for any kind of objects.
 * 
 * The easiest way to connect a message to another Wigbi data plugin
 * class is to add a synced data list to the data plugin and add the
 * message to that list. This makes sure that the message is deleted
 * together with the object to which it belongs.
 * 
 * Since messages will most probably be between objects, it may be a
 * good idea to add it to an "inbox" for the receiver object and add
 * a copy to an "outbox" for the sender object. By doing so, the two
 * objects have a copy each. If one message is deleted, the other is
 * still available to its owner.
 * 
 * The senderId and receiverId properties can also be used as object
 * reference to provide fully traceable messages.
