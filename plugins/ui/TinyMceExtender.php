/**
 * The Wigbi.Plugins.UI.TinyMceExtender PHP class.
 * 
 * This plugin can be used to apply Tiny MCE, which turns text area
 * elements into WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors.
 * 
 * To be affected by the plugin, text area elements must either use
 * the "wysiwyg advanced" or the "wysiwyg simple" CSS class. If any
 * such elements are loaded into the page with AJAX, after Tiny MCE
 * has been applied, Tiny MCE must be re-applied with JavaScript.
 * 
 * Before this plugin can be used, Tiny MCE must be downloaded from
 * the official site and added to the application. It is not a part
 * of Wigbi. To make this plugin easy to use, the number of setting
 * parameters have been kept to a minimum. If the basic behavior of
 * Tiny MCE should be modified, edit the JavaScript class file. 
 * 
 * 
 * JAVASCRIPT ********************
 * 
 * This UI plugin has the following JavaScript functionality besides
 * what is provided by the WigbiUIPlugin base class:
 * 
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>public void add()</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * Note that no AJAX is used when applying Tiny MCE with JavaScript.
