/**
 * The Wigbi.Plugins.Data.Rating class.
 * 
 * This class represents a rating that can be applied to any kind of
 * object. Ratings can either be anonymous or non-anonymous. 
 * 
 * An anonymous rating will only keep track of how many times it has
 * been rated and will recalculate its average score each time it is
 * rated. It is not possible to extract any additional info from it.  
 * 
 * To be able to extract detailed information, make it non-anonymous.
 * If a rating is non-anonymous, the createdBy parameter MUST be set
 * when executing the rate and unrate methods. It can be an ID or an
 * IP address...or whatever.
 * 
 * A rating can also be given a name, which can identify whatever is
 * being rated. This makes it really easy to bind a rating object to
 * another object without having to use a data list.
 * 
 * Data lists:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>ratings (Rating) - synced</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * AJAX functionality:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>public void getRatingValue(string createdBy, function onGetRatingValue(float result))</li>
 * 		<li>public void rate(double rating, string createdBy, function onRate())</li>
 * 		<li>public void unrate(string createdBy, function onUnrate())</li>
 * 	</ul>
