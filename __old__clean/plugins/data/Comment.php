/**
 * The Wigbi.Plugins.Data.Comment class.
 * 
 * This class represents a general comment that can be applied to an
 * object of any kind, even "non-existing", non-stored objects.
 * 
 * The comment author can be defined in various ways. If it is bound
 * to an object with an ID, then simply use the authorId prop. If no
 * ID exists, though, the author can be identified with name, e-mail
 * and URL.
 * 
 * The object to which the comment applies can also be identified in
 * two ways. If it is bound to an object with an ID, then simply use
 * the receiverId prop. If no ID exists, though, the receiver can be
 * identified with the receiverName property, which must be unique.
