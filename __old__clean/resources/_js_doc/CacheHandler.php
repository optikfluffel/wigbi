/**
 * The Wigbi.JS.CacheHandler class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to save and retrieve cached data. It fully
 * supports all serializible data and can thus store complex objects
 * as well as simple strings, integers etc.
 * 
 * Since this class is based on asynchronous methods, the cache data
 * will be handled by both JavaScript and PHP. Thus, complex objects
 * should not be cached without being serialized first.  
 * 
 * One important difference between the PHP and the JavaScript class
 * is that the cacheFolder property must be PAGE RELATIVE in PHP and
 * APPLICATION RELATIVE in JavaScript.   
 * 
 * See the documentation for the corresponding PHP class for further
 * information about how to work with caching.
