/**
 * The Wigbi.JS.LogHandler class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to log messages in various ways. Some log
 * targets require an asynchronous server call to the corresponding
 * PHP class while others are executed client-side.
 * 
 * One important difference between the PHP and the JavaScript class
 * is that the file property of every sub handler has got to be PAGE
 * RELATIVE in PHP and APPLICATION RELATIVE in JavaScript.
 * 
 * See the documentation for the corresponding PHP class for further
 * information about how to work with logging.
