/**
 * The Wigbi.PHP.SearchFilter class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to build search filters that describes how
 * to search for objects in the database.
 * 
 * A search filter is built up by search rules, sort rules, group-by
 * rules skip count and max count, which makes it ideal to use for a
 * paging operation. 
 * 
 * The class is convenient to use to programmatically build queries,
 * but if you know how to write SQL queries, you will probably only
 * use it for more basic search operations.
