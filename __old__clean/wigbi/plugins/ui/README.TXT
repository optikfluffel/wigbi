Wigbi UI plugin instructions
============================

Author: Daniel Saidi [daniel.saidi@gmail.com]


To add a UI plugin to a Wigbi application, just copy the two
plugin files (one PHP and one JavaScript) to this folder. If
the plguin just consists of one file, just copy that one.

Wigbi will automatically include and use all UI plugins that
are placed within the folder.
